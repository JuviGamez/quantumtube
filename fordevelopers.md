### This file is for developers who are wanting to find out how it works, this will soon be added to the documentation which will come out soon

# The "Getting Started" Dialogue:
The "Getting Started" Dialogue is shown to users who started using QuantumTube for the first time
#### It's Workings:
It works by specifying a tag in local storage called "quantumtube_first_time", if the tag dosen't exist, or its value is set to 0, it will start the "Getting Started" page, but if set to 1 (which will be set after the Getting Started has been completed)
it won't show it
